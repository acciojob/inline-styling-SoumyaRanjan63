		<p>Lavandula (common name lavender) is a genus of 47 known species of flowering plants in the mint family, Lamiaceae.
			It is native to the Old World and is found in Cape Verde and the Canary Islands, 
			and from Europe across to northern and eastern Africa, the Mediterranean, southwest Asia to India.[2]
            Many members of the genus are cultivated extensively in temperate climates as ornamental plants for garden and landscape use,
			for use as culinary herbs, and also commercially for the extraction of essential oils.[3] The most widely cultivated species, 
			Lavandula angustifolia, is often referred to as lavender, and there is a color named for the shade of the flowers of this species. 
			Lavender has been used over centuries in traditional medicine and cosmetics.</p>

		<p>A rose is either a woody perennial flowering plant of the genus Rosa (/ˈroʊzə/),[1] 
			in the family Rosaceae (/roʊˈzeɪsiːˌiː/),[1] or the flower it bears. There are over 
			three hundred species and tens of thousands of cultivars.[citation needed] They form 
			a group of plants that can be erect shrubs, climbing, or trailing, with stems that are
			often armed with sharp prickles.[2] Their flowers vary in size and shape and are usually 
			large and showy, in colours ranging from white through yellows and reds. Most species are 
			native to Asia, with smaller numbers native to Europe, North America, and northwestern Africa.
			[2] Species, cultivars and hybrids are all widely grown for their beauty and often are fragrant. 
			Roses have acquired cultural significance in many societies. Rose plants range in size from compact,
			miniature roses, to climbers that can reach seven meters in height.[2] Different species hybridize easily, 
			and this has been used in the development of the wide range of garden roses.</p>
